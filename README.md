# Battleship

by John A. Joyce 

## Description

Battleship is a two-player strategic guessing game with origins as a pencil-and-paper game played around the world since World War I. The objective is to sink the opponent's fleet of ships, the locations of which are unknown to the opposing player. Each player's fleet contains multiple ships of different sizes, arranged on a grid, and players alternate turns "firing" at the opponent's grid to hit and sink their ships. The player who sinks their opponent's entire fleet first wins the game.

## Getting Started 

You will play the game against a computer opponent. You get to fire first. Select a square on the "Enemy Fleet" grid to fire at it and see whether you hit one of their ships or missed. It will then be the computer opponent's turn to fire at your fleet, and you will see whether they hit one of your ships. The turns will continue to alternate until either you sink the entire enemy fleet or they sink yours. To start over, click the "New Game" button.
